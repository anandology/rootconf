            <h1>About Rootconf</h1>
            <p>A 1-day conference for sysadmins and BOFHs where the masters talk about configuration management in the cloud.</p>
            <h1>About HasGeek</h2>
            <p><a href="http://hasgeek.com">HasGeek</a> is a developer-led initiative, and has been un-organising the unconference scene since 2010. HasGeek is an attempt to solve the problem of insipid conferences organised around buzzwords by uninterested, soulless corporate entities who pitch them as company training events or as places for companies to pick up hot developers.</p>

            <p>We are attempting to build a new space, a space that is genuinely respectful of the communities and topics that we choose to engage with. We want to be a space for developers who are as excited as us about technology and the possibilities that it creates, not to be a recruitment fair (though we hope you do find partnership possibilities at our events).</p>
            
            <p>We are community-driven – check out our speaker-selection funnel, where you decide what talks to listen to by voting up or down – and small – there are just a handful of us running the show. We are doing this because this is what we love: bringing a whole bunch of us geeks together, sharing our interests and expertise and hanging out later over beverage of choice.</p>
